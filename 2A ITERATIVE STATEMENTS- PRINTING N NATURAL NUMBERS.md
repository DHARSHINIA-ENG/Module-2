## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINTING NUMBERS WITHIN THE GIVEN RANGE

###  Aim
To create a Python Program to print numbers range from M to N (including M and N values)

---

###  Algorithm

1. Start the program
2. Get the input integer a
3. Get the input integer b
4. Loop from i = a to b (inclusive):
5. Print the value of i on a new line
6. End

---

### ðŸ§¾ Program

```python
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
for i in range(a,b+1):
    print(i,end="\n")

```
### OUTPUT
